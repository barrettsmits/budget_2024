# Home Budget Web Application 

This python project is designed to create an easy to use web application that aggragates entered data for the user to create a Budget that includes totals and average monthly spending. 

This project replaces a 2019 excel file that was initial used for this process. 

## Project Goals:
With the basic outline created useing SQLAlchemy and Flask, adding tests and features to the application is the next milestone. 



## Easy data entry to start. 
Data entry is easy, and is restricted to three fields to start with, can add more in the future. 

## Easy to read output. 

Output is just raw numbers at this time.

# TODO
 
Savings Slider, a slide bar that changes how much can and should be saved in a interactive way. 
(current thoughts are a slider on top and a piechart on teh bottom showing monthly income vs. savings, vs expenses)

## Notes

This was created to be simiple but useful to me, it is a work in progress and I'll maintain this as long as I am using it. 
This project is the first time I'm using HTML in 15 years and I've not used Flask before. SQLAlchemy is also a new library for me.
